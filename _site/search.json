    "text": "I am an experienced researcher who is passionate about promoting health equity and environmental justice through research, communication, and education. My research interests focus on the complex role that social stressors and resilience factors play in modifying and/or mediating the effects of climate-related exposures on health. Currently, I’m working on analyzing these effects across New York State in the context of pediatric health. I am also part of a community-based air monitoring study in South/Southwest Philadelphia, which we co-designed with Philly Thrive, a local environmental justice organization.\nWith a background in organic chemistry (BA, Reed College ’15) and in Social and Behavioral Sciences (MPH, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health ’21), I understand that the determinants of population health operate on many scales, from molecular/biological to social/structural, throughout the life-course, and across generations.\nIn my free time you can find me bouldering, cooking, or listening to music."

In collaboration with then-PhD candidate Dr. Alexandria Macmadu in the Department of Epidemiology at Brown University, we combed through police reports of overdose calls to see how helpful police actually were on-scene during some of the deadliest years of overdose in the city. I continued collaborating with Dr. Macmadu after this project (March 2021 - Dec. 2022), gaining experience with qualitative data analysis while investigating social network response to overdose and the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on drug use behaviors.\n\n\nFrueh L, Collins AB, Newman R, Barnett NP, Rich JD, Clark MA, et al. Multi-level influences on increased overdose risk behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use drugs in Rhode Island: a qualitative investigation.

Michael Riscoe and Aaron Nilsen of Oregon Health & Science University. During this time period, I discovered ELQ-331, a novel pro-drug of promising preclinical antimalarial drug candidate ELQ-300. The discovery improved ELQ-300’s solubility and bioavailability, and ELQ-331 was brought into the Medicines for Malaria Venture’s drug development pipeline in 2020. ELQ-331 and associated pro-drugs were patented in 2020 [US Patent No. 10,584,098].\n\n\nPal AC, Renard I, Singh P, Vydyam P, Chiu JE, Pou S, Winter R, Dodean R, Frueh L, Nilsen A.
