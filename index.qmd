## About Me

I am an experienced researcher who is passionate about promoting health equity and environmental justice through research, communication, and education. My research interests focus on **the complex role that social stressors and resilience factors play in modifying and/or mediating the effects of climate-related exposures on health.**

Currently, I’m working on analyzing these effects across New York State in the context of pediatric health. I am also part of a [community-based air monitoring study](https://thriveairphilly.com/) in South/Southwest Philadelphia, which was co-designed with Philly Thrive, a local environmental justice organization.

With a background in organic chemistry (BA, Reed College '15) and in Social and Behavioral Sciences (MPH, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health ‘21), I understand that the determinants of population health operate on many scales, from molecular/biological to social/structural, throughout the life-course, and across generations.

In my free time you can find me bouldering, cooking, or listening to music.
